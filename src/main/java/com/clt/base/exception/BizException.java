     *         ... 3 more

     * stack trace of the exception that was caused by this exception (the
     * "enclosing" exception).  This shorthand can greatly reduce the length
     * of the output in the common case where a wrapped exception is thrown

     * As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
     * <i>suppressed exceptions</i> (in conjunction with the {@code
     * try}-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
     * suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
     * beneath the stack trace.  The format of this information
     * depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
     * regarded as typical:
     * <p/>
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Something happened
     *  at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
     *  at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
     *  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
     *          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *          at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
     *          ... 1 more
     * </pre>
     * Note that the "... n more" notation is used on suppressed exceptions
     * just at it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
     * indented beyond their "containing exceptions."
     * <p/>
     * <p>An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
     * exceptions:
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
     *  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
     *  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
     *          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
     *  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
     *          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
     * Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
     *  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
     * </pre>
     * Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
     *  at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:6)
     *  Suppressed: Resource2$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1

    /**
     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
     * of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
     * intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
     * will be true, and that the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
     * While it is typically the case that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
     *
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
     * {@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
     * {@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be the case that
     * {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
     *
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     *
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     *
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.
     *
     * @return a clone of this instance.
     * @throws CloneNotSupportedException if the object's class does not
     *                                    support the {@code Cloneable} interface. Subclasses
     *                                    that override the {@code clone} method can also
     *                                    throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
     *                                    be cloned.

     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p/>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p/>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p/>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p/>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p/>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p/>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
